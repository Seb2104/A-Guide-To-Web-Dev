# A Guide To Web-Dev

ACCESSIBILITY PROJECT - WPR1781
The internet has become a vital tool for education, providing access to vast resources for learners worldwide.
However, not all websites are designed to be accessible to everyone, particularly visually impaired users. The
goal of this assignment is for you to explore fundamental web concepts while creating an accessible
educational resource website that serves all users, including those with visual impairments such as
colorblindness or those using screen readers.
PROJECT [GROUP ASSIGNMENT / 30 POINTS]
Create a well-functioning educational resource website on a topic of your group’s choice (e.g., basic web
development, environmental sustainability, mental health awareness, or local culture). Your website must
present educational content and be accessible to visually impaired users, requiring you to research accessibility
best practices. Additionally, you must validate your website and host it, either locally or online, to demonstrate
its functionality.
Your final submission must be a well-constructed and well-arranged website that makes use of multiple types
and forms of content, including pictures, tables, forms, and lists. You will primarily be marked on your application
of good design principles that include, but are not limited to, the following:
• The structure principle
• The simplicity principle
• The visibility principle
• The feedback principle
• The tolerance principle
• The reuse principle
Overall, your assignment must demonstrate that you have a good understanding of basic web design concepts,
including accessibility, validation, and hosting. The following restrictions apply:
• CSS Grid must be used for the page layout. Using tables for the main page layout will result in heavy
penalties.
• All formatting must be applied using an external CSS file.
• You can pick any logo of your choice if you require that your website have one. However, a text-based
logo is preferred.
• Any menus that you create must be implemented using lists.
• There must be a hover effect on the menu items. See how you can get creative with this.
• Strictly observe HTML5 semantics.
• Include at least one CSS-only interactive feature (e.g., a dropdown menu or accordion).
• The website must include at least 5 pages (e.g., Homepage, Lessons, Quizzes, Resources, Contact).
• Use HTML5 validation for forms (no JavaScript).
• Include a research/reference document (2-3 pages) detailing your design process, accessibility
research, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and a list of resources used for accessibility
research.

Website Validation
Validating a website is the process of ensuring that the pages on the website conform to the norms or
standards defined by various organizations. You must use an online validator service; here is a link to some
tools: Developer Tools - W3C Developers. Your submission must include a report of the validation results for
your website.
Website Hosting
You must host your website and demonstrate its accessibility via the World Wide Web. You have two options:

1. Virtual Host
   Create a virtual host on your computer using a server stack like XAMPP or WAMP. Your submission in
   this case will be a short video (not more than 5 minutes) showing how you created the virtual server
   and accessed the website from the front-end. Use common sense and edit the video so that it shows
   the important parts.
2. Online Service
   Sign up with a hosting provider like Afrihost or any of the free ones. Your submission in this case will
   be a short video (not more than 5 minutes) showing how you used FTP software to upload the
   website, as well as a link to the live website.
   Presentation
   Each group will present their website in a 15-20 minute presentation, including a live demo and Q&A session.
   You will be assessed on your ability to demonstrate the website’s functionality, explain your design and
   accessibility choices, and answer questions about your implementation. Questions may cover topics such as
   HTML5 semantics, CSS techniques, accessibility best practices, validation results, and hosting setup.
   Deliverables
   • Website: A fully functional, accessible website meeting all requirements.
   • Research/Reference Document: A 2-3 page document detailing the design process, accessibility
   research, challenges, solutions, and references.
   • Validation Report: A report of the website’s validation results from an online validator service.
